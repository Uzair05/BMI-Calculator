# BMI-Calculator
A Java Based BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator to allow users to measure and track their BMI.

## Setup
Transfer the `src\` folder to the eclipse workspace and place the `Icons\` directory in the same level as the `src\` directory.

## Running
Open `Main.java` in eclipse IDE and click run.

### Alternative method
Compile all the java files and run using the command interface.

You can use the code.
```
cd ./src/
javac *.java
mv *.class ../bin
cd ../bin/
java Main.class
```

## Upcoming Updates
I will be adding a menu bar along with alternate options to input measurements in imperial.
